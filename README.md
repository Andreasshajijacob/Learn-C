**_C++ is a middle-level programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup starting in 1979 at Bell Labs. C++ runs on a variety of platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS, and the various versions of UNIX. This tutorial adopts a simple and practical approach to describe the concepts of C++._**
- **_C++ is a statically typed, compiled, general-purpose, case-sensitive, free-form programming language that supports procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming._**

- **_C++ is regarded as a middle-level language, as it comprises a combination of both high-level and low-level language features._**

- **_C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup starting in 1979 at Bell Labs in Murray Hill, New Jersey, as an enhancement to the C language and originally named C with Classes but later it was renamed C++ in 1983._**

- **_C++ is a superset of C, and that virtually any legal C program is a legal C++ program._**

## How to download :

 - **_Step 1  [Download Turbo C++ 3.2](https://www.developerinsider.in/download-turbo-c-for-windows-7-8-8-1-and-windows-10-32-64-bit-full-screen/) from here_**
- **_Step 2	 If any previous "Turbo C++" version install in your computer, then first of all uninstall that._**              
- **_Step 3	 Extract downloaded "Turbo C++ 3.2.zip" file._**
- **_Step 4	 Run "setup.exe" file._**
- **_Step 5	 Follow the setup instructions._**

## How to use Turbo c++ :

- **_Step 1	Double click on "Turbo C++" shortcut link on the desktop._**

- **_Step 2	If you want run turbo c++ on full screen simply click on button "Run Turbo C++"_**
- **_Step 3	"OR" If you not want full screen mode uncheck the "Full screen mode" check box and click on button "Start Turbo C++"_**

## How to write a C++ :

- **_Step 1 Create a main program file. The main file must include a function called main(). This is where execution of the program begins. From here, you should be calling functions, instantiating classes, etc. Other files of your application as well as libraries can be included into this file._**
- **_Step 2 Begin writing your program. Insert your code or the program that you need to build (see below for a few examples). Learn the syntax, semantics, Object-Oriented Programming paradigms, data striations, algorithm designs such as linked lists, priority queues, etc. C++ is not an easy language to program in, but doing so teaches you the fundamentals that extend to all programming languages._**
- **_Step 3 Insert comments in your code. Explain what your functions do and what variables are for. Choose clear names for variables and functions. Capitalize the names of global variables. In general: make sure that anyone reading your code can understand it._**
- **_Step 4 Use proper indenting in your code._**
- **_Step 5 Compile your code with g++ main.cpp_**
- **_Step 6 Run your program by typing:./a.out_**
